Dark things wander free
Keepers of the mysteries
Darkest brethren, it falls on thee
To still the breath of your enemies
A thousand miles, a thousand seas
I cross them all eternally
A thousand eyes, a thousand dreams
I walk among them endlessly
On the wings of leather and rage
I will rise in the face of their hate
On the wings of leather and rage
I will take all the things that I crave
Rebel spirits a call to thee
On this the dawn of your destiny
Rebel blood strong and free
Will never bow to the heavenly
A thousand miles, a thousand seas
I cross them all eternally
A thousand eyes, a thousand dreams
I walk among them endlessly
On the wings of leather and rage
I will rise in the face of their hate
On the wings of leather and rage
I will take all the things that I crave
